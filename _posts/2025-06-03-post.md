It was simply out of curiosity. CitySample is not working with animation sharing.

Mass Representation subsystem has special LOD system with ISM(Instanced Static Mesh) that can animate based on texture.
This system is quite good to increase the performance.

Still, High res geometry working with animation sequence.

Implementation and application began from the link below.

My animation state change implementation is not working correctly. Only Walk state is visible.
