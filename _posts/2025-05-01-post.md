My Macbook Pro has M1 Max. It dose not support atomic 64 in metal shader.

![TestScene0](/img/20250501/NaniteWithoutAtomic64_00.png)

Just try to split the 64bit buffer into two 32bit buffers. One is for depth, other onw is for visibility.

Here is the problem.

Depth buffer can use atomic max. and works fine. but visibility buffer... there is no depth info.
