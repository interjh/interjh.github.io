Performance tests. You can easily find out which one is the nanite based on prims, draws.

1. Performance tests

|Render Type|Results|
|:---:|:---:|
|Nanite|![TestScene0](/img/20250510/Nanite00.png)|
|Traditional|![TestScene1](/img/20250510/Nanite00.png)|

so As you can see the stat. Nanite one is quit slow on M1Max.

But it is not correct compare because the number of vertex are different.

I made a change of "CitySampleNaniteMeshLODGroup" as below.

<pre>
<code>
CitySampleNaniteMeshLODGroup=(NumLODs=4,MaxNumStreamedLODs=0,bSupportLODStreaming=0,LODPercentTriangles=25.0)
</code>
</pre>

2. Unreal insight

Nanite
