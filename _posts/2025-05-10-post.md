Performance tests. You can easily find out which one is the nanite based on prims, draws.

### Performance tests

|Render Type|Results|
|:---:|:---:|
|Nanite|[![Markdown Image](/img/20250510/Nanite00.png "Nanite")](https://interjh.github.io/img/20250510/Nanite00.png)|
|Traditional|[![Markdown Image](/img/20250510/Nanite01.png "Traditional")](https://interjh.github.io/img/20250510/Nanite01.png)|

So, As you can see the stat. Nanite one is quit slow on M1Max.

But it is not correct compare because the number of vertex are different.

I made a change of "CitySampleNaniteMeshLODGroup" as below.

<pre>
<code>
CitySampleNaniteMeshLODGroup=(NumLODs=4,MaxNumStreamedLODs=0,bSupportLODStreaming=0,LODPercentTriangles=25.0)
</code>
</pre>

### Summary
The M1 Max GPU is known to have similar performance to the RTX 2070. Nevertheless, Performance of CitySample is slower than windows PC.
I guess there are several reasons.
1. Async compute is disabled.
2. Mesh shader is disabled.
3. Memory bandwidth is little bit slower than RTX2070

Once I have this result, I'll start looking into async compute, and then I'll go back to Nanite.
